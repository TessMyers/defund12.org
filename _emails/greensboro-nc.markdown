body: "Dear Mayor Vaughan & City Council Members,\n \nMy name is [YOUR NAME]. I am
  a resident of [DISTRICT/NEIGHBORHOOD]. The police are killing Black people. They
  choke us to death like George Floyd in Minneapolis and Marcus Deon Smith in Greensboro.
  They invade our privacy and search us with no reason, like a 15-year-old boy who
  was stopped while running on the Greenway a week after Ahmaud Arbery was shot for
  running while Black. They arrest us for things that are legal for white people.
  We smoke weed at the same rates as white people and are 80% of the people who are
  arrested for marijuana. We are only 44% of the City.\n \nWe need to stop spending
  money on policing and harm. We need to start spending money on schools, teachers,
  guidance counselors, affordable housing, healthcare, childcare, livable wages, resources
  for domestic and sexual violence survivors, and everything that will help our communities
  thrive. Everything cannot be fixed overnight, and we need to change at every level
  of government. But there are things the Greensboro City Council has the power to
  do right now. And if they fail to act, we will need a new City Council. The City
  Council must use their power to pass ordinances instead of relying on the police
  to make temporary administrative changes. We  demand that the Greensboro City Council
  immediately:\n \nMake amends to the family of Marcus Smith, an unarmed man experiencing
  homelessness who Greensboro police hogtied and killed in the street.\n \nEnd the
  curfew and stop physically harming and arresting people who are not physically harming
  others.\n \nDefund the police, so they cannot buy militarized weapons to harm us.
  Fund Crisis Intervention and Recreation Centers.\n \nStop the police from being
  violent with us.\n \nTreat trans and gender non-conforming, intersex and other LGBTQ
  people with dignity.\n\nTreat people experiencing homelessness with dignity and
  stop criminalizing them.\n\nEnd arrests for marijuana.\n \nPublicly share data so
  we can understand how the police are treating us.\n\nMake the police get our signed
  permission before searching us without a warrant.\n \nAllow the Police Community
  Review Board to hold the police accountable.\n\n\nA CLOSER LOOK AT OUR DEMANDS\n
  \nMake amends to the family of Marcus Smith, an unarmed man experiencing homelessness
  who Greensboro police hogtied and killed in the street.\nApologize and adequately
  compensate the family of Marcus Deon Smith for his homicide death.\nFire the officers
  and their supervisors who helped cover up the homicide for their wrongdoing, demand
  that the county fire the paramedics involved, and issue a public apology from the
  City of Greensboro for the killing of Marcus Smith and over 50 years of police brutality
  and corruption.\nSet up a memorial to honor the life of Marcus Deon Smith and all
  other victims of police violence in Greensboro.\n \nEnd the curfew and stop physically
  harming and arresting people who are not physically harming others.\nImmediately
  end the curfew, which was set up to make it easier to arrest and to justify harming
  people who participate in civil disobedience.\nStop arresting people for violating
  curfew and for resisting arrest.\nStop allowing the police to put their hands on
  people who are not putting their hands on anyone else.\nStop using military weapons,
  materials, and tactics, to suppress people who are protesting for our for freedom.
  Demilitarize the police. Rubber bullets, other bullets, tear gas pepper spray and
  sound cannons must be prohibited.\n \nDefund the police, so they cannot buy militarized
  weapons to harm us. Fund Crisis Intervention and Recreation Centers.\nInvest in
  mental health workers to develop an in-house, adequately funded 311 number to give
  residents an alternative in crisis situations to calling the police. Residents should
  be able to access trained crisis workers – mental health providers and social workers
  to de-escalate and address a situation.\nInvest in more funding for organizations
  that act as alternatives to the police for interventions in mental health, sexual
  harassment, and domestic violence situations.\nInvest in the city’s recreation centers,
  to create safe, fun and well-funded spaces and fully-staffed programs for our youth.\nFund
  these programs with money that is normally spent on weapons, new cars, new policing
  gadgets, ATVs, segways, trainings that tell police officers to attack the public
  and promote the “Warrior Mentality”, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Fund these programs
  with money spent setting up check-points to shake down vulnerable people with expired
  plates and insurance, and money spent “preemptively” profiling Black people.\n \nStop
  the police from being violent with us.\nPass an Ordinance Requiring the Adoption
  of a Use of Force Policy that restricts police from physically harming us and:\nProhibits
  the use of chemical agents, sound cannons, and bullets- rubber or otherwise on groups
  of civilians.\nRequires officers to de-escalate situations where possible by communicating
  with subjects, maintaining distance, otherwise eliminating the need to use force.\nDoes
  not allow officers to choke or strangle civilians.\nRequires officers to intervene
  and stop excessive force used by other officers and report these incidents immediately
  to a supervisor.\nRestricts officers from shooting at moving vehicles, which is
  a particularly dangerous and ineffective tactic.\nSpells out and limits the types
  of force and/or weapons that can be used to respond to specific situations.\nRequires
  officers to exhaust all other means before resorting to deadly force.\nRequiring
  officers to give a verbal warning, when possible before shooting at a civilian.\nRequiring
  officers to report each time they use force or threaten to use force against civilians.\nLays
  out disciplinary measures up to and including termination for violating the Use
  of Force Policy.\n \nTreat trans and gender non-conforming, intersex and other LGBTQ
  people with dignity.\nRequire the Police Department to implement Standard Operating
  Procedures (a set of rules across the department) for officers when interacting
  with trans, gender non-conforming, intersex and other LGBTQ+ people that require
  officers to:\nTreat trans, intersex, and gender non-conforming people in a manner
  appropriate to their identity, which may be different from the sex they were assigned
  at birth or is listed on their government ID.\nUse the trans, intersex, gender non-conforming
  person’s chosen name and pronouns.\nNot use slurs or derogatory words to people
  based on their gender identity.\nSearch people following departmental procedures
  based on people’s gender identity- not sex at birth.\nRequire officers to go through
  Trans 101 trainings led by very well compensated trans & gender non-conforming people.\n\nTreat
  people experiencing homelessness with dignity and stop criminalizing them.\nPass
  an Ordinance requiring the Police Department to implement Standard Operating Procedures
  for police when dealing with people experiencing homelessness which acknowledges
  that homelessness is not a crime and that people experiencing homelessness retain
  their constitutional rights to privacy, equal treatment before the law and protections
  to be free from cruel and unusual punishments regardless of their housing status.\n\nEnd
  arrests for marijuana possession.\nPass an ordinance requiring that the Police Department
  stop arresting, fining and charging people for possession of marijuana. Without
  prohibitively expensive lab testing, it is indistinguishable from CBD and hemp products
  that are legal in the state of North Carolina, as described in a memo by the State
  Bureau of Investigation. Further, the Guilford County District Attorney has stopped
  prosecuting for marijuana possession under 1.5 ounces.\n \nPublicly share data so
  we can understand how the police are treating us.\nShare data quarterly on incidences
  of uses of force, disparities in policing and arrests, and complaints against the
  department and officers.\nShare data quarterly on charges, citations, arrests, and
  fines by race, gender, ethnicity and age.\n\nMake the police get our signed permission
  before searching us without a warrant.\nAdopt the Written Consent Policy put forward
  by the Greensboro Criminal Justice Advisory Commission in February of 2020.\n\"Greensboro
  police officers who search persons based on their consent should obtain voluntary
  consent from those persons (1) by verbally informing them of their right to refuse
  a search and (2) by securing written consent through the GPD Consent to Search Form.”\nUse
  clear language in the Consent to Search Form to let people know that they have the
  right to say no to a search.\nAdd language to the Consent to Search Form that lets
  people know they have the right to change their mind and withdraw consent.\nRequire
  Officers to read the Consent to Search form to the person being searched.\n \nAllow
  the Police Community Review Board to hold the police accountable.\nDo not require
  the PCRB to sign a non-disclosure agreement, or threaten them with financial penalties
  and/or jail time.  \nDo not require complaints to go through Internal Affairs before
  being reviewed by the PCRB.\nPass a resolution in support of the State of North
  Carolina authorizing Police Community Review Boards to have subpoena power.\n\nThank
  you, \n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ADDRESS]\n[YOUR EMAIL]\n[YOUR PHONE NUMBER]"
